# Solution
- Construct Adjacency List Graph and perform DFS directed cycle detection

# Time Complexity
- Optimisations
  - Could get rid of the second array for the stack by using the visited array with extra numbers
  - Can probably just use a normal list instead of hashmap because we're working with numbers
